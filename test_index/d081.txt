the automated multilevel encyclopedia as a new mode
of scientific communication .

the computer revolution encourages reexamination
of the encyclopedia concept .  no longer confined
to book form, it can be enlarged to embrace several
 levels of condensation from a library-sized store, with updating,
text preparation, access, and distribution handled
 differently at different levels, partially replacing, at base
 level, the journal system .
