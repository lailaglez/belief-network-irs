An information retrieval system based on belief networks

A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model 
is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their 
conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the 
probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the 
probabilities of the presence of various diseases.

The system includes a user interface, memoization for increased performance, a simple retroalimentation system and several
document collections for testing.
